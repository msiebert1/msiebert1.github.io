<span style="color:#44465B">Can Measuring SN Ia Velocities Improve Cosmological Distance Measurements?</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We used kaepora to investigate the spectra of 126 SNe Ia that have cosmological distance measurements. Using composite spectra, we found evidence that SNe with negative Hubble Residuals (those with underestimated distances relative to a cosmological model) tend to have higher velocities. In the figure to the right, we show the velocity evloution of the Si II $\lambda$6355 feature for the positive/negative (blue/red) Hubble Residual samples. For more information please take a look at our recent paper ([Siebert et al. 2020](http://msiebert1.github.io/files/Siebert_2020_02_20_MNRAS.pdf))
