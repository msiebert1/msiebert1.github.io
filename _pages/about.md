I am a postdoctoral fellow at STScI studying the explosive deaths of stars in the universe. I am generally interested in astronomical transients and have used a large variety of ground- and space-based resources to obtain their follow-up observations across the EM spectrum. I have supported this work by developing a spectroscopic reduction pipeline tailored for optical observations of transients.

I am particularly interested in probing the physics of Type Ia Supernovae in order to improve our cosmological distance measurements. I developed the SQL database (Kaepora) to facilitate this research and I have also spent time studying peculiar White Dwarf supernovae to better understand the types of progenitor systems that may be present in our cosmological samples.

More recently, I have worked on characterizing the most distant stellar explosions with JWST.

<!-- How did I get here?

Way back in my middle school years I remember a night out with my closest friends. We decided to take a shortcut through the woods back home, but little did we know, my friend's dad was waiting to scare the crap out of us. He did his best impression of a bear and we all scattered in terror. Running through the woods with no light, I eventually hit my head on a tree branch and was knocked flat on my back. Time stood still for a second and I remember gazing at the twinkling of the stars through the tree canopy. I took a moment and thought... "Wow... my head really hurts." 

Years later, I ended up getting a degree in engineering and using that to pursue a career in astronomy. Most people in academia will at some point question why they decided to take such an arduous path. You really have to love what you do. 

This gets me thinking. I am still here and looking for more, so I must really love what I do. I often think the reason for this is having the priviledge to spend every day following my own curiosity. But, I would be lying if "minor brain trauma as an adolescent" wasn't also a damn good explanation. -->
